          <h5>Effort Estimation</h5>
          <p>
          Effort estimation was done using a modified version of the table stack method, which would normally involve
          a table and setting user stories relative to each other and the table. We decided to do this over planning
          poker as we thought it would be more efficient with the large number of stories we had to estimate. This was
          done online in a skype call and a google excel doc. We first arranged a list of the user stories to be 
          estimated in a column to the left and assigned numbers to each. Then, we decided on the scale we would use 
          to place our stories. Row #2 represented the stories requiring the least effort, and row #31 represented the
          stories requiring the most possible effort. Stories with similar difficulties would be placed in adjacent 
          columns. We then took turns amongst all members. On each member’s turn, they would either grab a new story 
          from the basket and place it where they thought it fit on the ‘table’, or move an existing story on the 
          ‘table’ to another location. Note that all estimations were relative to the first user story that was
          implemented (we had estimated it to need the least amount of effort, therefore it was placed in row #2).
          </p>
          <p>
          After all the stories were estimated at least once, we agreed that some stories were very similar in 
          difficulty (ex. registering online for a class, registering online for a membership, registering online 
          for a class during early bird, etc. All these tasks had the similar function of storing a form into a 
          database, and a paypal transaction). After going through and grouping all tasks we deemed would have the
          same difficulty, we continued rearranging and updating the positions of user stories on our turns until 
          everyone was content with what we had - ie people stopped moving things in their turns. We then quickly 
          went over every user story as a group to validate why we thought a user story’s difficulty was a good place 
          relative to the others. Then, each story was assigned its row number minus one (to make things easier user 
          story in row #2 is assigned 1, not a 2) as its effort required.

          </ul>
          <h5>Prioritization By Product Owner</h5>
          <p>
          After we estimated as a team we set up a meeting with our product champion. Both Stacy and Linda were given
          a list of the user stories, together we went through each user story. We explained all our user stories and
          went through each one, asking if each one was mandatory, or optional. After going through this list, they 
          marked nearly all user stories as mandatory. We then explained to them that we would not be able to complete 
          all their desired features due to time constraints. We continued to explain which tasks required significantly
          more effort than others, and what challenges we would have to face. Our product champion was unsure of what 
          to cut out, so we asked them to prioritize between a membership registration system, or a class registration 
          system. 
          </p>
          <p>
          After reminding them of what they really wanted this system for, Linda and Stacy agreed that they would want 
          a registration system - to help cut down on the lineups at the start of the registration period. They 
          included that they had still wanted to keep features like waitlisting and storing doctor’s notes as high 
          priority items. We then went through the new list of mandatory user stories and asked them if they had to, 
          what they would give up. They concluded that the most important feature they would like, is the admin
          functionality followed by online member class registration functionality. Finally, we also asked them to sort 
          through the non-mandatory features into a basic and advanced membership registration list - so we would know
          which features to implement in the case that we are able to fully implement the mandatory features. Therefore,
          user stories pertaining to class registration are high (admin functionality of this is marked as very high),
          and user stories relating to membership are low or very low.
