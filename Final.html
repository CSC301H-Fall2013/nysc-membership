          <h6>Remaining Unimplemented User Stories</h6>
          <p>Due to time and resource constraints, there were several user stories allocated for the final sprint that were not fully implemented by the end of the sprint. The incomplete material for the sprint consisted of two tasks categorized under user story 10A, which included implementing auto-generated participant ids and passwords. There was an attempt made to complete these tasks, but due to other interfering components, we were unable to complete it in a timely manner. This particular user story was not high on the implementation priority list because it was the result of determining that there are several flaws in previously completed user stories which needed fixing during the most recent meeting with the PC. The user story was deemed to be unnecessary for the fundamental functionality and does not have a great impact on user experience, so it ended up unfinished.</p>

          <p></p>From the entire pool of user stories in the product backlog, user stories that were not allocated to a sprint included user stories: 9, 27, 28, 1, 3, 23, and 24. Since the implementation time of the end product was limited to the bounds of a semester, it was determined that there is insufficient time to finish all the user stories. The identified user stories would provide additional features for both the administrators and participants, but they are not part of functional requirements. They were determined to be of a low priority and non-essential for the core functionality of our system, thus they were not be implemented for the end product.</p>

          <h6>Developer Design Document</h6>
          <h6>Reflection on development process</h6>
          <p>The development process for the North York Senior Centre's registration web application has been a long and eventful learning experience for all members in Team Superior.  There were both good and bad decisions that we made as a team and despite the shortened development cycle and small number of sprints, we continually made an effort to learn from our mistakes to improve as students and developers.</p>

<p>It was concluded that Ruby on Rails was a bad choice of web framework because it was poorly documented and there was time limitations for the entire group to learn it, but overall, our group does not regret using it since it is an invaluable knowledge asset that we can use in the future. </p>

<p>One of the pitfalls of developing a complex piece of functional software from scratch in a half year course while balancing a full course load is there is insufficient time to complete a fully functional and visually appealing product along with documentation. There were substantially shorter periods of time allocated for sprints compared to real life scenarios and that impacted the number of user stories which could be fully implemented by the due date.</p> 

<p>Furthermore, poor design and planning earlier on in the development process negatively influenced the amount of work that could be completed. A more developed and well-thought out design in user interface and framework earlier on could have provided more clarity and prevented confusion regarding design and requirements throughout the development process. </p>

<p>As a group, we werenâ€™t able to fulfil our task of meeting up with our product champion every week due to the long commute for all members and the time which not a lot of the members had. The lack of meetings as a group with the PCs may have lead to fewer new updates that could have been completed, but communication via email had updated them with what was done with the application.</p>

  <p>Overall, the team was very effective in communication aspect since members were not hesitant to ask or speak what was on their mind about the project towards the group. The team had good response times of answering within 12 hours via our chosen communication channels of Facebook and WhatsApp. This allowed us to keep everyone updated on a daily basis of what was done that day, even if nothing was done. </p>

          <h6>Installer/Deployment</h6>
          <p>The registration system is currently accessible at: <a href="https://github.com/CSC301H-Fall2013">http://nysc.herokuapp.com/</a> </p>
<p>If the Product Champion decides to adopt our application for official use and would like to use a specific custom domain name, they are welcome to contact us at any time. Custom domain configuration in Heroku involves a simple change to the settings.</p>
