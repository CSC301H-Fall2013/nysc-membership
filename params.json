Our system will allow prospective and returning members, as well as non-member participants, to apply for or renew membership in addition to register for upcoming programs and events at the NYSC. Where required, online payments will be handled in a secure manner via PayPal. E-mail notifications will also be an integral part of our system: for example, when annual memberships are approaching renewal time, reminders for an upcoming event or program for which one is registered, and when a change in waitlist status has occurred in regards to a program or event. <br>\r\n\r\nOur online system aspires to increase outreach and accessibility with regards to involvement at the NYSC. With the new system, registration for programs may be conducted in the comfort of individuals' homes, rather than manually at the NYSC, on paper and pen. A digital CRM will also be of great benefit to staff and volunteers, in the form of hours freed up from manually sorting and organizing papers, as well as through offering a convenient manner of generating aggregate statistics for organizational planning and direction.\r\n<br><br>\r\n**Team Charter**\r\n\r\n**Technologies**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
