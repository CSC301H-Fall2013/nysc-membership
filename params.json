{"name":"NYSC Membership","tagline":"Team Superior: Online Membership & Registration System for the NYSC.","body":"### Overview\r\n**Team** <br>\r\nCody W. - @codywong <br>\r\nJana R. - @jana-uoft <br>\r\nMichelle L. - @michyliao <br>\r\nEalona S. - @ealonas <br>\r\nJessica L. - @jessiluu <br>\r\nKirien C. - @fromtheothershore <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**Project Charter** <br>\r\nWe are building a web-based membership and program registration system for the North York Seniors Centre. Our system will allow prospective and returning members, as well as non-member participants, to apply for or renew membership in addition to register for upcoming programs and events at the NYSC. Where required, online payments will be handled in a secure manner via PayPal. E-mail notifications will also be an integral part of our system: for example, when annual memberships are approaching renewal time, reminders for an upcoming event or program for which one is registered, and when a change in waitlist status has occurred in regards to a program or event. <br>\r\n\r\nOur online system aspires to increase outreach and accessibility with regards to involvement at the NYSC. With the new system, registration for programs may be conducted in the comfort of individuals' homes, rather than manually at the NYSC, on paper and pen. A digital CRM will also be of great benefit to staff and volunteers, in the form of hours freed up from manually sorting and organizing papers, as well as through offering a convenient manner of generating aggregate statistics for organizational planning and direction.\r\n<br><br>\r\n**Team Charter** <br>\r\nWe commit to communicating regularly on our individual and shared progress through group text messaging, e-mail, and in-person meetings. In-person team meetings will occur at least once per week on either Monday, Wednesday, or Friday; more frequent if necessary, depending on work load and availabilities. We recognize that each of us have extensive responsibilities outside of this course, but individually make the commitment to honour our personal role and vitality towards the final outcome of the project. We are also committed to communicating regularly with our client, and keeping them informed with regards to each iteration of the product. <br><br>\r\n\r\n**Technologies**<br>\r\nblah","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
