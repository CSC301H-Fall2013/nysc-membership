              <td> After meeting with the PC, it was determined that implementing functionality for the administrators takes precedence over implementing the functionality for participant-end interaction since administrators are able to perform any task a member may want to perform, on behalf of the member. Completing all these user stories will require setting up the infrastructure for all tables in our database which will allow future sprints to build easily on what had been established. These stories are also more important than any other, because even with only these stories, our system can still bring value to NYSC by providing them with a more organised and efficient system for keeping track of their classes.

As a team, it was decided that completing these functionalities for the administrators remained a priority over all other unimplemented features since admin functionality formed the core of our system. These storiesâ€™ tasks were then re-assessed and re-assigned to new user stories for this sprint. </td>

              <td>With administration features implemented, the focus will shift to implementing the participant registration functionality, the next highest priority item. The tasks necessary for member registration were not allocated to a sprint as it was agreed with our product champion that these were not necessary features, and should be only done upon completion of all other higher priority items. It was collectively decided that we should focus on completing what is absolutely necessary since this is the final sprint before the product release.
