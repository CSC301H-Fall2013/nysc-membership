<h5>Team Charter</h5>

<strong>Regular Meeting Times</strong><br>
<p>All members of Team Superior have committed to two in-person group meetings; Thursday at 11:00 am to 12:00 pm 
(location BA2175), Monday at 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm (location BA3200).</p>
<p>Along with these two in-person meetings, we have also agreed on a modified daily stand-up meeting; modified 
meaning we meet via messenger (WhatsApp) daily for fifteen minutes from 12:00 pm to 12:15 pm.</p>

<strong>Values</strong><br>
<p>Our group's main values consist of shared learning and curiosity. We share a common understanding of 
education: it is more than an integer (our grades). Education is about choosing to learn something new, and sharing 
that knowledge amongst those around you. It is not looking for the easy way out, but following curiosity into a new 
domain. You may come to hate your new found knowledge, but at least you'll hate it together (curiosity may have killed 
the cat, but it would never take on a clowder). This is why our group has chosen to use Ruby on Rails; a language all 
members are using for the first time.</p>

<p>Communication, honesty, and respect are the key elements of a functional relationship with any group of any size. 
Our group abides by the values of honesty, respect and communication. This allows us to build a relationship that 
either excels in success, or falls in failure, as a unit. We respect each other enough to be able to voice out any 
need for, or offer of, help to one another. We will not silently fail out of fear of being ostracized from the group; 
in contrast, any problems brought forth will be seen as an opportunity for growth for all members.</p>

<p>It may seem odd to group these together but alas; diligence, and community. Diligence is written last, not because 
it is any less of a value for our group, but so that it is understood that asking for help when in doubt is a part 
of being diligent. All members understand that although a task may have a name assigned to it, each member is
responsible for helping one another succeed; this is what brings about our group’s sense of community (it is your task,
but our project).</p>


<strong>Commitments</strong><br>
<p>Our primary communication avenues are E-mail and text message. We each commit to respond to a text within one hour 
(three hours the latest), and respond to emails that require a response by the end of the day.</p>
In addition, we all have agreed upon visiting the Team’s facebook group at least once a day, at any time convenient.<br>
<p>If a member cannot make it to either a daily meeting, or an in-person meeting, they must give a twenty-four hour notice 
via email stating the reason for their absence. Depending on the importance of the meeting, the rest of the members 
can choose to conduct the meeting without the member in question, or change the time-slot for that particular meeting
to accommodate them.</p>

<h5>Team Charter</h5>
<p>We are building a web-based membership and program registration system for the North York Seniors Centre. Currently, 
membership and class registration is done in pen and paper at the Centre, and all client records are kept in a paper 
filing cabinet. This project aims to provide more convenience to both those who participate at NYSC as well as those
that work there.</p>

<p>Our system will allow members to renew their memberships and register for classes online. Non-members must also be
able to create new memberships as well as register for classes. Registrations done online should be handled in a secure
manner via Paypal. Registrations should still be able to be processed and paid in person, by having a staff person or 
volunteer add the user into the database.</p>

<p>When complete, NYSC should be able to redirect clients who are interested in registering for programs and membership
to the online registration system. Registrants will no longer be forced to wait in long lines to secure spots in their 
favourite classes. The Centre will no longer have to allocate a large amount of time and resources for volunteers and 
workers to manually process these forms. Allowing online registration will also increase the saturation of the Centre’s 
target market; as such, the Centre should see a trend in the short-to-long term of an overall increase in activity and
participation post-launch of the online system. Finally, Centre staff should report that a digitized client management 
system helps paper-saving, as well as greater ease with regards to generating and analyzing aggregate client 
statistics.</p>





<strong>Technologies to be used</strong><br>
<p>The web application will be developed with the Ruby on Rails framework, which we have collectively chosen out of personal
interest, motivated by a desire to all learn and become familiar with a new technology. All of our source code and 
documentation will be version controlled on GitHub, with our GitHub project webpage used as the main medium in sharing
our work and progress. The GitHub pages feature is easy to use, publicly accessible (should we later choose to feature 
our work in our individual portfolios), and most of all makes it easy for those who may not be familiar with GitHub 
itself to easily gain a high-level understanding of the project.</p>
<p>For the database, we will be employing sqlite3, which comes by default with Rails. The web server is currently being
hosted with an Ubuntu VM on Windows Azure, and we plan to integrate an Apache server in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>Team Meeting Records</strong><br>
Meeting minutes and spreadsheet will be on <a href="minutes.html">a separate page</a>.</p> <br>
