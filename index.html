<h6>Team Charter</h6>
<p>
Regular Meeting Times<br>
  All members of Team Superior have committed to two in-person group meetings; 
  Thursday at 11:00 am to 12:00 pm (location BA2175), Monday at 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm (location
  BA3200).<br>
  
  Along with these two in-person meetings, we have also agreed on a modified daily
  stand-up meeting; modified meaning we meet via messenger (WhatsApp) daily for fifteen 
  minutes from 12:00 pm to 12:15 pm.<br>
  
  Values<br>
  Our group's main values consist of shared learning and curiosity. We share a common
  understanding of education: it is more than an integer (our grades). Education is about choosing 
  to learn something new, and sharing that knowledge amongst those around you. It is not looking
  for the easy way out, but following curiosity into a new domain. You may come to hate your new 
  found knowledge, but at least you'll hate it together (curiosity may have killed the cat, but it would 
  never take on a clowder). This is why our group has chosen to use Ruby on Rails; a language all 
  members are using for the first time.<br>
  Communication, honesty, and respect are the key elements of a functional relationship with any group of 
  any size. Our group abides by the values of honesty, respect and communication. This allows us to build 
  a relationship that either excels in success, or falls in failure, as a unit. We respect each other enough
  to be able to voice out any need for, or offer of, help to one another. We will not silently fail out of
  fear of being ostracized from the group; in contrast, any problems brought forth will be seen as an 
  opportunity for growth for all members.<br>
  It may seem odd to group these together but alas; diligence, and community. Diligence is written last, 
  not because it is any less of a value for our group, but so that it is understood that asking for help
  when in doubt is a part of being diligent. All members understand that although a task may have a name
  assigned to it, each member is responsible for helping one another succeed; this is what brings about 
  our group’s sense of community (it is your task, but our project).<br>
   Commitments<br>
   Our primary communication avenues are E-mail and text message. We each commit to respond to a text 
   within one hour (three hours the latest), and respond to emails that require a response by the end of 
   the day.<br>
   In addition, we all have agreed upon visiting the Team’s facebook group at least once a day, at any
   time convenient.<br>
   If a member cannot make it to either a daily meeting, or an in-person meeting, they must give a
   twenty-four hour notice via email stating the reason for their absence. Depending on the importance
   of the meeting, the rest of the members can choose to conduct the meeting without the member in question,
   or change the time-slot for that particular meeting to accommodate them.<br>
</p>

<br><p><strong>Technologies</strong><br>
The web application will be developed with Ruby on Rails, hosted and deployed through Windows Azure. <br><br></p>

<p><strong>Team Meeting Records</strong><br>
Meeting minutes and spreadsheet will be on <a href="minutes.html">a separate page</a>.</p> <br>
